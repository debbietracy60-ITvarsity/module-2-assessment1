               <h3>MONKEYS</h3>
                <p>Monkeys are clever, social animals. They are known for running and leaping through trees with ease. Like apes and humans, monkeys belong to the group of mammals called primates. Monkeys look somewhat like apes such as chimpanzees, orangutans, and gorillas. But monkeys differ from apes in several ways.</p>
                <p>they are intelligent,social animals, especially the old world monkeys of Catarrhini most of them have a tail even if it is a short one,</p>
                  <p><strong> Where will you find them?</strong></p>
                  <p>You will find the monkeys in the entrance number A11 next to the Giraffes</p>
