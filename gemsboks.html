               <h3>GEMSBOKS</h3>
               <p>Gemsbok have a horse-like posture and gallop and have muscular necks and shoulders. They have a long tail with black flowing hair. Both male and female gemsbok have long, sharp, pointed horns (female horns are longer and more slender). These horns can extend up to 33 inches in height.</p>
                <p>it is one of the few antepole species where female trophies are sometimes more desirable than male ones.</p>
                  <p><strong> Where will you find them?</strong></p>
                  <p>You will find gemsbok near panda's canyon</p>
